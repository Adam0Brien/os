# Disable bits primarily from fedora-coreos-config

# https://github.com/coreos/afterburn/issues/405
# When we changed to inherit from FCOS we started enabling this service
disable afterburn-sshkeys@.service

# Explicitly disable: it's enabled by default otherwise but will fail because
# we don't ship with the kargs needed for enablement.
disable kdump.service
