# RHEL CoreOS config

This repository is the "config" repository used to build
RHEL CoreOS using [coreos-assembler](https://github.com/coreos/coreos-assembler/).

There was a previous git repository inside the Red Hat
firewall never published.  The history of that repository
is entangled with various private things and is omitted.

Going forward, this repository will be canonical; more
to come.
